# Kubeconfig Plugin for Arcaflow

The Kubeconfig plugin is used to input a kubernetes or openshift kubeconfig file and parse and extract components of the kubeconfig file such as cluster name, user, server url, client certificate, client token etc.

The plugin expects a kubeconfig inputed as a string, as defined in the `InputParams` dataclass in [kubeconfig_plugin.py](kubeconfig_plugin.py) file.
You define your test parameters in a YAML file to be passed to the plugin command as shown in [kubeconfig_example.yaml](kubeconfig_example.yaml)
